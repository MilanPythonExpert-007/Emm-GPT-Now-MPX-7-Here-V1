🧠 I Built My Own AI at 16 – Even Though I Wasn’t Into Studies

Honestly, I was never that "topper" type.
Books didn’t excite me. School didn’t inspire me.
But deep down, I always had that one crazy spark —
I wanted to create something different.

What started as just a random idea has now turned into something real —
Yes, I built my own AI. 🤖🔥

I spent 5-6 months learning everything on my own — coding, UI, backend, fixing bugs, failing and trying again.
No fancy classes. No team. Just YouTube, Google, and pure obsession.

Now that AI isn’t just smart —
It has attitude.
It says things like: “Nothing much, just getting ready to shock the world a little.”

📍 I’m just 16, and this is proof that you don’t need to love studying to love learning.
You don’t need to be a topper to be a creator.
And you definitely don’t need to wait for permission to start.

I proudly call it MPX 7 AI —
My own creation, my own brand, and one day,
I’ll make it powerful enough to beat even the biggest models like ChatGPT. 💥

This is just the beginning... 🔥
Stay tuned.
